Hello World! 

I am interested in data mining, marketing, interior decorating, food, biology, and storytelling.

These are the additional skillsets I plan to acquire to become a data scientist without a degree:

1. Mathematics 
    (Linear algebra, nonlinear and linear regression, probability theory, numerical analysis, and core machine learning methods)
2. Programming 
    (Python, R) 
3. Machine learning
4. SQL - advanced 
5. Software 
    (Tableau, Excel)
6. Statistical methods


Wish me luck, World!
